# hello-world

Hello All!

My name is Anthony. I am a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst studying climate dynamics and modelling. I use state-of-the-art numerical models to simulate changes in the climate. Specifically, I am testing how the massive export of very thick, ancient sea ice could affect ocean circulation and thus global climate.

I come from a background in Meteorology from Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I currently hold a B.S. in meteorology and M.S. in Geoscience.
